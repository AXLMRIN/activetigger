## What is Active Tigger ?

ActiveTigger[^old] is an text annotation web tool dedicated for computational social sciences. It is designed to assist exploration and model ([BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model))) fine-tuning to annotate text dataset relying on active learning.

[^old]: The current version is a refactor of [R Shiny ActiveTigger app](https://gitlab.univ-lille.fr/julien.boelaert/activetigger) (Julien Boelaert & Etienne Ollion). Active Tigger name is a pun that draws on the similarity between the words 'Tagger' and 'Tigger.'


## How to start ?

First, you need to access a running instance :

- Deploy you local instance (with a GPU if you want shorter computation time, but it can run on CPU)
    - locally 
    - on a cloud server (for instance [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/public-cloud))
- Get access to existing instance
